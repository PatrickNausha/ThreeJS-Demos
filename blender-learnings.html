				<h2>Asteroids Minigame</h2>
				<p>
					The following are things I learned while creating <a href="./asteroids.html">my Asteroids clone</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>Procedurally generated asteroids</h3>
				<p>
					Instead of modelling individual asteroids repeatedly, I saved time by generating them procedurally
					and tweaking the inputs until I found something I liked. I used a chain of Geometry Nodes to produce
					the asteroids. In order, these were
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Node to create an icosphere that was distorted into a random, less spherical shape. This is the
						base for the asteroid.
					</li>
					<li>A node that created random craters.</li>
					<li>A repeat of the random craters node to apply more craters of a smaller size.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Nodes for random asteroid shape</h4>
				<p>
					I used an Ico Sphere node to start with a round shape and then used a noise texture to offset the
					vertices into random locations to produce a random, yet natural-looking shape. Here's what the final
					Geometry Nodes ended up looking like:

				/></a>
				<h4>Nodes for craters</h4>
				<p>
					I followed
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIGpGezfz2A&ab_channel=TwoDancingClams" target="_blank"
						>this tutorial video</a
					>
					but used the following simplifications.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I used the new
						<a
							href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/3.5/modeling/geometry_nodes/geometry/sample/geometry_proximity.html"
							>Geometry Proximity Node</a
						>
						which makes it much easier to compute the distance between any point and the center of a crater.
						Note: The Transfer Attribute node used in the YouTube tutorial
						<a
							href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/276087/where-is-transfer-attribute-in-3-4"
							target="_blank"
						>
							has been removed in Blender</a
						>
						so you may need the Geometry Proximity Node alternative anyway.
					</li>
					<li>
						Instead of having the same Geometry Nodes modifier generate all craters, I applied the same
						nodes multiple times. This made the nodes easier to write and gave me more fine-grained control.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Here's what the final Geometry Nodes ended up looking like:</p>
